1. Using the compile options to display resource usage, it was reported that each thread used 12 registers and the shared memory usage per block was 2104 bytes. This was then put into the CUDA Occupancy calculator which showed that the occupancy of each SM is 100%. Forty-eight warps can be scheduled and with 32 threads per warp, this leads to 1536 threads per SM. This allows for 23,040 threads to be scheduled across 15 SMs in the GPU.
